/* --- Terminal yield-quench controller (spec-decode Item 4) ---------------
 * Controller design after the Entrpi ds4 yield quench (v0.1.1, MIT): per
 * request, every fused spec step accrues debt = breakeven yield minus
 * realized yield; when the request has provably lost more than a small
 * budget of plain tokens to speculation AND its recent yield is still below
 * breakeven, speculation turns off for the REMAINDER of that request
 * (terminal; a new request re-arms).
 *
 * Breakeven derivation (calibrated 2026-07-17 against per-step
 * DS4_DSPARK_STATS traces of the production v5mx serving path — 2585 steps
 * across prose/structured x greedy/T1.0, least-squares, resid rms 7.2 ms;
 * offline method after Entrpi's dspark_trace_replay, tool:
 * temp/quench/quench_replay.py):
 *   fused spec step   ~= FLAT + ROW * n_batch   milliseconds
 *     FLAT: pooled fit 101.6 ms, SHIPPED 95.7 ms — see the greedy-fit
 *           paragraph below for why the lower bound is the one compiled in
 *           (batched projections + shared + drafter dense/markov + sampled-q
 *           readback/dist walk — flat in verify rows; the old 53.6 ms nsys
 *           figure was the draft=3 build before temperature-matched drafting)
 *     ROW:  pooled fit 19.15 ms, SHIPPED 18.37 ms (marginal verify row —
 *           bandwidth-bound; matches the 2026-07-09 nsys 19.7 ms/row audit)
 *   plain decode token = PLAIN(pos), piecewise-linear through the measured
 *     served-plain depth table (2026-07-15, medians of 3): 59.7 ms @0.3k,
 *     67.3 @2.3k, 68.7 @9.3k, 74.5 @38k. Depth-dependence matters: spec step
 *     cost is ~flat in depth while plain slows, so a scalar PLAIN would
 *     overprice speculation exactly in the deep cells where it wins most
 *     (e.g. sweep-prose greedy @2.3k, +11.7%).
 * The breakeven yield of a step that verified K drafts at frontier pos is
 *   guard = (FLAT + ROW*(1+K)) / PLAIN(pos)     [plain tokens]
 * ~2.9 at full depth shallow, ~2.0 for a draft-only step. A request whose
 * committed tokens/step run below guard would have been faster plain.
 * Charging the ACTUAL n_batch (post conf-sched trim) rather than a scalar
 * guard prices exactly the steps the trimmer already shortened; committed
 * likewise is the post-trim realized yield. Measured operating points:
 * t2x prose y~2.05 vs guard ~2.8 (loses -> quench), structured y~5.1-5.3 vs
 * guard ~3.5 (wins by >1.5 -> never quenches).
 *
 * FLAT/ROW are the greedy-prose fit (the LOWER bound across the four
 * calibrated cells; the sampled cells fit ~6-11 ms higher FLAT). Deliberate:
 * underpricing the spec step biases against quenching, which keeps the
 * borderline deep greedy cells (sweep prose @2.3k: y~3.2 vs guard 3.06,
 * wins +11.7% measured) strictly on the no-quench side of the model.
 *
 * WARMUP: the first steps of every request are drafter pipeline fill —
 * n_batch ramps 1->2->3 with near-zero commits while the pendings build and
 * the prompt window seeds (a one-time ~40 ms not in the step model). That is
 * a fixed startup cost every request pays, not evidence about proposal
 * quality — charging it was measured (2026-07-17, first Load-2 gate run) to
 * book ~4.9 debt by step 6 at 2.3k ctx and spuriously quench the WINNING
 * sweep-prose cell (16.6 -> 14.8 t/s). The controller therefore ignores the
 * first DS4_QUENCH_WARMUP steps entirely, and MINEV=8 (Entrpi's replay
 * default) delays the verdict until the EWMA reflects steady state.
 * Re-validated offline over all 17 Load-1 traces + deep synthetic steady
 * states: losers (shallow y~2.05, deep y~2.5) fire at tokens ~11-25;
 * winners (struct, deep y>=3.2) never fire.
 *
 * Debt is deliberately NOT clamped below (matches Entrpi's shipped default):
 * unclamped, debt is exactly the request's NET plain-token-equivalents lost,
 * so the quench fires iff the request is genuinely >= BUDGET behind plain —
 * banked credit is real measured savings being spent, not optimism. Entrpi
 * measured the zero-clamped variant false-quenching long bursty winners, and
 * our offline replay selftest reproduces the same false quench for any
 * finite credit cap on a net-positive bursty request. Budget = 4 plain-token
 * equivalents (~250 ms): large enough that per-step yield variance on a
 * winning request cannot cross it (compounded with the EWMA and MINEV
 * conditions), small enough that a 400-token losing request recovers nearly
 * all of the loss.
 *
 * The controller reads only (commit, n_batch) — counts, never wall-clock —
 * so for a fixed token stream the quench point is deterministic. Constants
 * are compile-time (no hot-path env reads; project rule). */
