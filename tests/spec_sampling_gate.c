/* Statistical oracle for exact sampled speculative decoding.
 *
 * Promoted from temp/archive-2026-07-14/spec_sampling_test.c. temp/ is
 * transient and we have already lost harnesses that way (the Tier-2
 * byte-compare harness is gone; only gates promoted to tests/ survived), and
 * this is the ONLY end-to-end check that the speculative path emits the exact
 * target distribution.
 *
 * From one frozen session state, generates N short trajectories two ways:
 *   A) plain sampling (ds4_session_sample + eval per token)
 *   B) speculative   (ds4_session_generate_speculative, drafter active)
 * and chi-square-compares the per-position token marginals. If the acceptance +
 * residual-carry scheme is exact, the two are the same distribution; a biased
 * sampler shows up as a fat chi-square at position 1+ (position 0 is the same
 * plain draw in both paths by construction).
 *
 * The oracle is PROPOSAL-AGNOSTIC: it compares emitted marginals and never
 * inspects how a draft was proposed. It therefore validates the deterministic
 * (argmax-proposal, accept w.p. p) rule and the temperature-matched
 * (sampled-proposal, accept w.p. min(1,p/q), residual (p-q)+) rule unchanged —
 * which is exactly what makes it the gate for spec-decode Item 1.
 *
 * Also runs the greedy gate: temp=0 speculative output must agree with plain
 * greedy for a long prefix, and must be deterministic run-to-run.
 *
 * Reports acceptance alpha (accepted drafts / proposed drafts) from the
 * engine's own counters, so the same run answers "is the sampled proposal
 * beating the greedy p(mode) acceptance ceiling?".
 *
 * *** READ THIS BEFORE "FIXING" THE DEEP CHI-SQUARE ***
 * This gate's own test compares mode 0 (plain, sampled from SINGLE-TOKEN DECODE
 * logits) against mode 1 (speculative, p read from the BATCHED verify rows).
 * Those are two different numeric paths. They are KNOWN to diverge on near-ties
 * — the Tier-2 driver control proved the batched sweep diverges from classic
 * decode using only pre-existing code on an untouched baseline ("batch-sweep
 * DIVERGES from classic decode at step 18", gaps 0.03-0.26). So at depth this
 * test has a systematic difference between its arms that is NOT a sampler bug,
 * and it sits near crit even on the SHIPPED engine (measured: baseline at ctx
 * 6017, traj 2000 -> pos3 chi2=21.3 vs crit 22.6, i.e. 94% of threshold).
 *
 * Consequence: a deep FAIL here does NOT by itself indict the sampler. Measured
 * TVD between arms, ctx 6017 traj 2000:
 *     fixed    mode0 vs mode1 : 0.0530 / 0.0605  (pos2/pos3)
 *     baseline mode0 vs mode1 : 0.0400 / 0.0445
 *     fixed mode1 vs baseline mode1 : 0.0130 / 0.0180   <-- 3-4x smaller
 * The two speculative engines agree with EACH OTHER far better than either
 * agrees with plain decode: one shared artifact, both rules exact.
 *
 * To test the SAMPLER rather than the numerics, dump both engines (argv[6]) and
 * run tests/spec_sampling_compare.py — mode1-vs-mode1 removes the confound
 * because both arms are batch-sourced. The proper repair of THIS test is to
 * have mode 0 read the same batched rows (a 1-row spec batch, drafter off) so
 * it compares like with like; until then, treat a deep mode0-vs-mode1 FAIL as
 * "engine numerics", not "sampler bias". The batch-vs-decode divergence is a
 * real engine property we are deliberately NOT fixing here.
 *
 * MODEL-DEPENDENT — needs the merged drafter gguf and ~95 GB free. Run:
 *   make cuda-spec-sampling-gate                  (defaults to gguf/model.gguf)
 *   ./tests/spec_sampling_gate <model.gguf> [temp] [filler_tokens]
